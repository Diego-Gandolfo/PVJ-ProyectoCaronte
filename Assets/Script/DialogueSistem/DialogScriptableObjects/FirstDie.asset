  - Don't worry, Kronk! We have a system so this doesn't become a big delay in your
    mission.
  - As you can see, you have only a part of the crystals that you had collected.
    Try to remember where you were before being returned to your ship. There you
    will find a Backpack that will have some of the crystals that you are missing!
