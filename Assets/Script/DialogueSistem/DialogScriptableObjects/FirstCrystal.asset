  dialogueStrings:
  - I see you got your first crystal. Well done!
  - Get some and then you can exchange them for upgrades near your ship. With some
    of them you will be able to access new places and others will help you to perform
    better.
  - You can also deposit the Crystals that you collect to avoid losing them if something
    happens during your explorations.
